# MNRS
This project takes an individual E003989 in the T1D dataset as an example to illustrate the specific application of the MNRS method. The input data can be changed with the other datasets if necessary.

Calculating multi-factor difference network input data: E003989_data.txt (contained in the data.zip)

Output data: changedata.mb

Running pipeline: networkbuild.R
